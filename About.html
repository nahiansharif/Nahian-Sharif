    <h2>Nahian Sharif</h2>
    <p>I am a 3rd year student at the University of Houston-Downtown. I am from Bangladesh, and I moved to USA in 2015. When I was in High school, I had no
      school friends because I didn't know how to speak English properly. Language barrier and cultural gap has caused me to face a lot of problems, but video games and
      online friends kept me motivated and calm during these tough times. Friends were not always there, but video games were. That's why I entered the University to learn programming
      so, I can make video games that can keep people away from stress and feel hopeful. During my time at the University, I realized that I can also solve many complex problems as a Software
      Engineer. That means, people can move forward without worrying about these issues that I already solved. It doesn't matter if I become a game developer, or Software Engineer as long
      as I am helping others to stay away from stress and dark times.

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I worked as a game director for 2 projects, and as lead programmer for 2 class projects. In 2019, I begin working on my first game.
        I used Unreal Engine 4 for programming, and Blender to create animations, characters, and objects. The character design was done by a co-worker,
        the rest was done by me. The development was finished in July 2020. In my second and third year at the university, I worked as a lead programmer
        on two class projects using C++ programming language. Another game is in development where I still have the same role, but I am also the character designer.
        My co-worker is the sound designer in this project. I learned how to make website for my studio.
      </p>

      <p>
        From my experience, I learned that the development could go smoothly with a team. I sharpened my problem-solving, critical thinking, and leadership skills.
        I improved my coding and communication skills. I have learned more techniques and knowledges to come up with a better algorithm and game mechanics from the development.
        As a web developer, I learned how to make fantastic, friendly user interfaces.
