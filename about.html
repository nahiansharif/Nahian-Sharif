      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        I’m a senior at the University of Houston-Downtown studying computer science. As someone who has lived in the USA for seven years, I know firsthand how the internet has transformed our lives. From blogs and websites to social media and online communities, the internet has made it easier than ever to learn, create, and connect with others.
      <br> <br> For me, the internet has been an incredible tool for learning programming. Despite having no family members who are programmers, I was able to teach myself because of the helpful resources and communities online. This led me to create my own game in my unique style, which was a rewarding experience that showed me the power of the internet for learning and creativity.
    <br> <br>  Now, as I pursue a career in web development, I'm excited to use my skills to help others learn and create on the web. I'm passionate about using technology to make the world a better place, and I believe that the internet is a powerful tool for achieving that goal. Whether I'm building websites, developing apps, or exploring new technologies, I'm always eager to learn and grow as a web developer. Let's create something amazing together!

<h1>Experience</h1>
<br><br>
<p>
  I have gained diverse experience in customer service and technology, working in different roles at Burlington and the University of Houston-Downtown. As a cashier, I served and assisted over a hundred customers daily with a smile and a positive attitude. As a computer lab assistant, I helped fifty students weekly with their technical needs, troubleshooting software and hardware issues.
  <br><br>
  Besides, I have pursued my passion for technology by working on various personal and school projects. I developed a web application for a university, where I used my back-end development
   skills and learned some basic front-end techniques to create a user-friendly interface. I also created a GUI C++ application that extracts, transforms, and loads data, providing a
   powerful tool for data management. Additionally, I built a business database that enables users to keep track of their employees/coworkers and financial status based on their roles, using my database management
   skills.
  <br><br>
  Finally, I worked on developing video games that feature various game mechanics, such as a progression system, chess puzzles, a souls-like combat system, boss fights, dialogues, support items, a shop, and a skill tree upgrade system. Throughout these projects, I learned how to collaborate effectively with team members, which helped me sharpen my problem-solving, critical thinking, and leadership skills. I also improved my coding and communication skills, and gained more knowledge and techniques to develop better algorithms and game mechanics. As a web developer, I learned how to create fantastic, user-friendly interfaces that meet clients' needs and expectations.

<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<br>
<p>
  One of my passions is creating and playing games. I have always been fascinated by the endless possibilities of game design, and I love to explore new ideas and mechanics. In my spare time, I enjoy developing my own games using tools such as Unreal Engine and C++. I believe that creating games is not just a hobby but also a great way to develop creativity, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking.
<br> <br>
  Another area of interest for me is creating informative websites. As a computer science student, I have a strong foundation in web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, EJS, and NodeJS. I enjoy creating websites that are both visually appealing and informative, providing users with engaging content and a seamless user experience. Whether it's a personal project or a professional one, I always strive to create websites that are responsive, accessible, and user-friendly.
